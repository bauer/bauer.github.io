bauer.github.io - GitHub Pages Dedicated Repository

User & Organization Pages live in a special repository dedicated to GitHub Pages files.
Content from the master branch will be used to build and publish your GitHub Pages site.

You will need to name this repository with the account name.
You must use the username.github.io naming scheme.

You can only use your own account name for a User or Organization Page repository. 
When User Pages are built, they are available at http(s)://<username>.github.io.
